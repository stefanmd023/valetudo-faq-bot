The @BanValeBot is the single, most advanced bot for answering questions regarding Valetudo.
It's enormous corpus contains over $:data_corrupted:$ answers! Thanks to the state-of-the art datacenter in a nearly moisture-free German basement and high-speed DSL, its uptime is asymptotically approaching 24 hours. It is currently not known what happens then.

Currently, the most useful command is /faq - just append one or more keyword to search for, like "/faq vaers".

You can also use the same commands in a private chat at @BanValeBot.
